**# Instructions**


**Problem-Statement:**
The United States faces a critical physician shortage crisis, exacerbated by a pattern where a significant number of physicians in residency programs are predominantly matched to highly populated regions and larger hospitals. As a consequence, this distribution of physicians creates systemic gaps in healthcare access and delivery, leaving various areas across the country, including [specify relevant regions], underserved and struggling to meet the healthcare needs of their communities.

**Goal of Project: **
The primary goal of this project is to map and analyze healthcare-related data across different states in the United States, aiming to create a comprehensive overview of general health conditions and identify physician shortages in various regions. By utilizing data mapping techniques and advanced analytics, the project aims to:

 1. Assess General Health Conditions: Gather and analyze various health indicators, such as disease prevalence and key public health metrics, to understand the overall health status of different states.
 2. Identify Healthcare Disparities: Examine healthcare access and delivery disparities across regions, highlighting areas with limited physician availability and inadequate healthcare infrastructure.
 3. Quantify Physician Shortages: Utilize data on resident physicians' distribution and regional healthcare demands to identify states and specific areas facing severe shortages of qualified healthcare professionals. (Final Project Implementation)
 4. Support Healthcare Policy Development: Provide evidence-based insights to inform policymakers and stakeholders about the pressing need for healthcare reforms and resource allocation to address the identified gaps.
