# American_Health_Dashboard

Group 4 Proposal (American Health and Wellness Dashboard)
Datasets:

 2022 Release - 2019 & 2020 : https://data.cdc.gov/resource/epbn-9bv3.json
 
 2023 Release - 2020 & 2021 : https://data.cdc.gov/resource/eav7-hnsx.json

Goal of Project: Using two-year health data from the CDC to create visuals for the data.

Problem-Statement:

Visualization of the data is currently focused towards simple monitoring and tracking. This presents a unique challenge for visualization and interactivity; the new dashboard will solve for this by providing:

Improved Interactivity and data insights.

Improved trend visualization featuring heat-mapping for data.

Healthcare and Mental Health Resource Needs:

Insurance levels across the United States (create a dashboard that allows users to see the various areas of the US that have coverage and the density of coverage).

Display general healthcare & mental health trends across the US.


Due to the heavy volume of data if we use all of the data points from the CDC, filtering on five (5) data points would be the best approach

Cancer (except Skin)
Coronary Heart Disease
COPD
Obesity
Diabetes
Health Insurance
Annual Checkup

For Machine Learning, we'll be using the KNN model since we have few datapoints as comparison.
