Goal of Project: Using multi-year health data from the CDC to create visuals for the data.


Problem-Statement:


Visualization of the data is currently focused towards simple monitoring and tracking. This presents a unique challenge for visualization and interactivity; the new dashboard will solve for this by providing:


Improved Interactivity and data insights.


Improved trend visualization featuring heat-mapping for data.


Healthcare and Mental Health Resource Needs:


Insurance levels across the United States (create a dashboard that allows users to see the various areas of the US that have coverage and the density of coverage).


Display general healthcare & mental health trends across the US.


Due to the heavy volume of data if we use all of the data points from the CDC, filtering on five (5) data points would be the best approach


Diabetes

Heart Disease

Cancer

Asthma

Depression

For the ML, using multi-model to determine the best model
